# Password Generator

I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. 
 It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.
