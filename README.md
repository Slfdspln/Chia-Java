##  Description 
I created an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria.

This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by my JavaScript code. 
 It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This project utilizes HTML, CSS, & JavaScript

## Installation

1.Clone the repo: git clone git@github.com:Slfdspln/password-generator-java.git

2.Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

## Usage Information

To run the application, navigate to its directory using the command line, install dependencies (npm i), and run the command "node index.js". Answer the questions that follow and once done, a message will appear confirming the logo generation. Check the newly generated SVG file for your new logo.

For unit testing, refer to the Test Instructions section.

## Features

The page's features are highly intuitive for users. Upon clicking the "generate password" button, a series of confirm prompts guide the user in selecting the desired character types and password length. Once all prompts are answered, the generated password is displayed within the "your secure password" text box.
